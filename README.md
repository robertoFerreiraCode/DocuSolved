# Description
An application used to convert text based images to plain text, built with React, JavaScript, and SCSS.
Accenture group hackathon tasked with improving how developers write documentation with input from screenshots of error messages. The documentation contained screenshots of errors which are difficult to search for due to them not being in plain text. Our solution sought to remedy this by converting the screenshots to plain text utilising Optical Character Recognition software, namely, Google Cloud Vision API. The application utilises a React front end for users to easily interact with the API, providing drag and drop functionality.

Note: Due to Google vision API subscription expiring, the application is no longer functional. However, the front end is still usable.
